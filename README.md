# Python Data Structures & Algorithms 🚀

This repository contains my implementations of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Python**, along with explanations, time complexities, and practice problems.
I’ve created this repo to strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.

### Sorting Algorithms
```python
from dsa.sorting import bubble_sort, selection_sort, insertion_sort

arr = [5, 2, 9, 1]
print("Original Array:", arr)
print("Bubble Sort:", bubble_sort(arr))
print("Selection Sort:", selection_sort(arr))
print("Insertion Sort:", insertion_sort(arr))
```
